# Detecting credit fraud using Self organising maps

This Git repository contains code and data for implementing a credit card fraud detection system using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The dataset `credit_card_applications.csv` is provided for analysis.

## Dataset
The `credit_card_applications.csv` file contains customer information and credit card application data. The dataset is used to train the SOM model and identify potential fraud applications.

## Jupyter Notebook
The main code is implemented in the Jupyter notebook named `SOM.ipynb`. This notebook contains the step-by-step implementation of SOM, visualization of the SOM grid, identification of potential fraud applications, and the printing of customer IDs associated with these applications.

## Dependencies
To run the code successfully, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- minisom
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas minisom matplotlib
```

## Acknowledgements
I acknowledge the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science" by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. The course provided valuable insights into SOM and credit fraud detection techniques, which served as a foundation for this project.

## Medium Article
For a detailed explanation of the code and the analysis, refer to my Medium article titled "Detecting credit fraud using SOMs." The article provides insights into the implementation of the SOM model, its application for identifying potential fraud applications, and the significance of the results.
